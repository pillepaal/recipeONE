# recipeONE 
####  by Pilleriina Paal

### My software developer bootcamp project. 

#### Why are we doing this? 
This final project is done to reflect everything we have learnt during our bootcamp. 
For my final project I have chosen to do recipe project. 
My project is encapsulating concepts from all core training modules, more specifically this will involve
##### Agile and Project Management (Git, Jira)
##### Database (MySQL)
##### Programming Fundamentals (Java)
##### API Development (Spring boot)
##### Automated Testing (JUnit, Mockito)

#### How I expected the challenge tto go? 
Considering the fact that I personally had zero experience in anything tech related at all, I was aware it will be very difficult. 

#### What went well? What did not go as planned? 
To be honest, absolutely nothing went as planned! Over the last 8 weeks I have gained ridiculous amount of new knowledge, 
and to use it all together first time has proved to be very challenging. 

#### Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
I would love to (and I will) carry on improving this project every way possible. At the end I would love to have an app where you can type in ingredients you have handy
and it would give you a recepies what you can do with these ingredients. At this moment my knowledge is too limited for this. 


## I will add link for my Jira board and also risk assessment in PDF format.
